# Pastry-shop

### A begginer practice for creating a cake-shop using just HTML and CSS, also understanding the take of requirements from the customer.

### This project counts with the customer side, in which we can see all the offers that the cake-shop make for them, the selection of ingredients and pricing.
### Then we have the login for the administrator and the main admin site, in which we can see the supplys and the inventory.
